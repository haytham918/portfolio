          , on a project to renovate the 3DSSPP Software, commissioned by
          VelocityEHS. The work I have contributed to led to a $5 million-worth
          patent in application. Due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement, I'm limited
          in the specifics I can share. However, I can outline my contributions
          to this innovative endeavor.
        </h4>
        <h4 className="description">
          My role centered on reengineering the existing 3DSSPP software
          features to enable operation via command-line inputs and automated
          processes, bypassing the need for a graphical user interface. This
          redesign facilitated the swift extraction of user-provided
          information, generating output files and video frames with enhanced
          efficiency. The result was a significant acceleration in data creation
          and the capacity for seamless integration with other applications.

        <h4 className="description">
          This project was a deep dive into deciphering and refining legacy
          code, some of which was over eight years old. It marked my inaugural
          foray into developing a Windows MFC application and deepened my
          experience with C++ application in a novel domain. A notable aspect of
          my role was employing bash scripting and modifying legacy code to
          devise practical solutions, thereby sharpening my problem-solving
          skills.
        </h4>
        <h4 className="description end-text">
          The experience was not just about technical enhancement but also about
          applying my competencies in the realm of Civil & Environmental
          Engineering. It broadened my understanding of another engineering
          discipline, fostering a more multidisciplinary perspective in my
          approach to problem-solving and innovation.
