      <h4 className='time-info'>Aug. 2021 â€” May 2022</h4>
      <h4 className='description'>In my senior year at high school, I did my capstone project that researched Linear Programming under the advising of Mr. Reed Coots and Dr. Greg Martin. I spent roughly ten months on this project, and finished with a 110-page paper and a schoolwide presentation.</h4>
      <h4 className='description'>Over the course of my capstone, I analyzed over 30 literatures on the history of the development of Linear Programming as well as its variant algorithms and applications. I studied the essense of the distinct algorithms such as the Simplex Method and the Graph Method, comparing their advantages and drawbacks. Then, I devised my own Python programs that solve optimization problems, which is the goal of Linear Programming, based on different algorithms.</h4>
      <h4 className='description'>Throughout the process, I gained a lot of experience conducting independent research and improved my academic writing skills with the help of my advisors.<br></br></h4>
